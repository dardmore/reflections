Question 1:  On initialization of the repository, git creates the base files needed for a new repository.

Question 2: The staging area is different than the working directory because changes cannot be made to the file.  It is different than the repository as changes made to this file are not permanent.  The value is that it give the user the chance to make sure that the version that is permanent is exactly what is wanted.

Question 3: Once the file is in the staging area, a git diff --staged will allow you to know if all changes made was to fix one issue.

Question 4: Branches help when I want to move a web design in a completely different direction but need to make sure the original master is in tact.  It will also help record all updates made.

Question 5: A diagram is a nice visual that shows all branches that have been made and how easiest to return to that branch.

Question 6: Merging two branches together brings together changes that both branches have been added.  The diagram is represented the way it is in order to make it clear that there are no longer two branches but only one that has come together.

Question 7: Pros of automatic merging is that git will tell merge new parts that don't have any conflicts and it will notify you when there are conflicts and indicate where these conflicts are.  Cons of automatic merging the automatic addition of new code has the potential of causing errors.
